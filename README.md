# Development

JetKVM is written in Go & TypeScript. with some bits and pieces written in C. An intermediate level of Go & TypeScript knowledge is recommended for comfortable programming.

The project contains two main parts, the backend software that runs on the KVM device and the frontend software that is served by the KVM device, and also the cloud.

For comprehensive development information, including setup, testing, debugging, and contribution guidelines, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

For quick device development, use the `./dev_deploy.sh` script. It will build the frontend and backend and deploy them to the local KVM device. Run `./dev_deploy.sh --help` for more information.

## Backend

The backend is written in Go and is responsible for the KVM device management, the cloud API and the cloud web.

## Frontend

The frontend is written in React and TypeScript and is served by the KVM device. It has three build targets: `device`, `development` and `production`. Development is used for development of the cloud version on your local machine, device is used for building the frontend for the KVM device and production is used for building the frontend for the cloud.
